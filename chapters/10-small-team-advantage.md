## Chapter 10: The Structural Advantages of AI-Native Small Teams

> "The era when small teams can win... We have no burden, we can completely revolutionize productivity in all our links as much as possible."

> Extended reading: How conventions help small teams maintain stability, see [*Conventions and Development Standards—Let AI Dance in Chains*](./11-conventions-and-standards.md). For the complete knowledge workflow pipeline that small teams can implement, see [*Meeting Recording→PRD→TDD→Code—AI-Native Team's Knowledge Workflow*](./13-knowledge-workflow-pipeline.md).

### 1. Large Companies vs. Small Teams: Who's More AI-Native

On the surface, large companies have more money, more people, more infrastructure,  
seemingly better positioned to do AI transformation.

But in reality, AI-Native actually favors small teams:

- Large companies have massive historical systems and processes, hard to fully refactor
- Many processes, standards, and acceptance chains are designed around "humans writing code"
- Even if AI is introduced, it often can only do "small upgrades" in a few links

> "In a large company, out of 100 links, it can innovate in at most 10 links.  
>  We small teams are different. We have no burden, we can completely revolutionize productivity in all our links as much as possible."

### 2. AI-izing 100 Links: Multiplication Effect Far Exceeds Addition

Roughly breaking down a complete software engineering process, you can easily list dozens to hundreds of links:

- Requirement interviews, PRD, solution review
- Architecture design, technology selection, DB design
- Development, integration, testing, deployment
- Log analysis, alerts, fault troubleshooting, retrospective documentation
- ...and so on

In traditional transformation thinking:

- Large companies might pick 5–10 links to do AI acceleration
- Each link improves efficiency a bit, overall effect is "addition"

Small teams can do something large companies find very hard:

- **From the start, assume: 100 links can all be AI-ized**
- Don't presuppose "this link must be done by humans, that link can't be given to AI"
- Use a unified AI-Native design approach to string all links together

When 100 links have all been redesigned,  
the overall improvement is no longer addition, but more like "multiple rounds of compound multiplication effects."

### 3. Fewer People = Need AI More, But Also More Opportunity to Use AI to the Fullest

A direct consequence of AI is: **each person's productivity increases, but team size actually decreases.**  
This is actually good for small teams:

- You already have few people, won't have overly complex organizational structure
- New processes, new conventions, new workflows can be unified across the team quickly
- Don't need to "promote an AI tool" through multiple layers of management and review chains

At the same time, because there are fewer people:

- You don't have extra manpower to do a lot of repetitive work
- You're more motivated to use AI to the fullest in every link
- Including what you're doing in this manifesto: have AI help organize workflows, help organize chapters, help solidify methodologies

### 4. Heavier Constraints, More Stable Small Teams Run

In AI-Native teams, there's another important view:

> "The importance of Convention and development standards for AI-Native teams will only be higher... Let AI dance in chains."

This statement especially holds for small teams:

- You can design many constraints from the start of the project: naming conventions, directory structure, testing conventions, documentation format
- Have AI "trapped" by these constraints from day one, only dancing within legal boundaries
- This will greatly slow the system's "entropy increase speed"

Large companies wanting to forcibly add such constraints to existing systems has very high cost;  
Small teams can do this almost "at zero cost" from the start.

### 5. Summary: AI-Native Is a Window of Opportunity for Small Teams

In summary, AI-Native doesn't bring a "stronger get stronger" Matthew effect, but gives small teams a new window of opportunity:

- Large companies find it hard to fully refactor, can only upgrade locally
- Small teams can reshape 100 links in AI-Native ways from the start
- When all links have been redesigned once, overall efficiency will far exceed large companies that only add AI locally

This doesn't mean small teams will definitely win, but at least it means:

- In this era, small teams are no longer naturally at a resource disadvantage
- As long as you dare to "all in AI" on processes and workflows,
- There's an opportunity to use very few people, in very short time, to do things that used to require a large organization to complete.
